# Retail_Store_SQL

I answered 5 high level business questions.

    What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
    What city sold the most products?
    What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
    What products are most often sold together?

To answer these questions the raw data was transformed using 'update', 'round', 'datepart', 'set' and 'Delete' statements. Aggregation functions along 'group by' and 'order by' were used to extract the necessary information to answer questions above. For the last question I did a 'self join' in such way that each pair was count ony one time.

This project was also carried out with excel which allows the data visualization on a dashboard. You can check it here --> [here](https://github.com/Fran-Sierra/sales_retail_stores)
